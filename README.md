# MCU SQLite Mini Project

A small, hands-on project to practice **SQLite database design, data handling, and querying** using the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as sample data.  

## What It Does
- Creates a relational database for **Productions, Characters, Appearances, and Phases**  
- Seeds data from a CSV using a Python script  
- Demonstrates **SQL queries**, including aggregations, timeline exploration, and phase-based analysis  

## Learning Goals
- Designing relational schemas (1-to-many, many-to-many)  
- Normalizing and cleaning raw data  
- Writing SQL queries and exploring data relationships  
- Using Python to seed and interact with a SQLite database  

> Note: This project was completed with the **assistance of online resources and AI tools**, including ChatGPT, to support learning and workflow.  

> A lightweight, portfolio-ready project to practice **databases, SQL, and Python integration**.
