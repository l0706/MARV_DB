# üß∞ Step 1: Set Up Your Gear

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install SQLite

* Visit [sqlite.org/download.html](https://sqlite.org/download.html)
* Download the **precompiled binaries** for your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux)
* **Add SQLite to your PATH** so you can use `sqlite3` in your terminal

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install VS Code and the SQLite Extension

* Open the **Extensions panel** in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
* Search for **‚ÄúSQLite‚Äù** (the one by **alexcvzz** is recommended)
* Click **Install** ‚Äî allows you to open and query `.sqlite` databases directly in VS Code

---

# üé¨ Step 2: Create Your Database

```bash
sqlite3 marvel.db
```

Inside SQLite:

```sql
.tables   -- check tables (there will be none yet)
```

---

# üö™ Exiting SQLite

### üß≠ Proper Exit

```sql
.exit
```

or

```sql
.quit
```

### üõë Emergency

* **Ctrl + C** ‚Üí interrupts current command
* **Ctrl + D** (Linux/macOS) or **Ctrl + Z + Enter** (Windows) ‚Üí force quit

> ‚ö†Ô∏è SQLite auto-commits ‚Äî `.exit` is safe.

**Useful commands:** `.tables`, `.schema`, `.mode csv`, `.output file.csv`

---

# üß± Step 3: Build Your MCU Schema

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Productions

```sql
CREATE TABLE Productions (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title           TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    type            TEXT CHECK (type IN ('Movie', 'Series', 'One-Shot', 'Adjacent')) NOT NULL,
    release_date    DATE,
    mcu_phase       INTEGER,
    timeline_start  INTEGER,
    timeline_end    INTEGER,
    note            TEXT,
    created_at      DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

üí° Notes: Simple, flexible, scalable; `timeline_start/end` for multi-year productions; `note` for trivia

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Characters

```sql
CREATE TABLE Characters (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name            TEXT NOT NULL,
    alias           TEXT,
    actor           TEXT,
    first_appearance INTEGER,
    species         TEXT DEFAULT 'Human',
    affiliation     TEXT,
    note            TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (first_appearance) REFERENCES Productions(id)
);
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Appearances

```sql
CREATE TABLE Appearances (
    production_id   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    character_id    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    role            TEXT CHECK (role IN ('Main', 'Supporting', 'Cameo')) DEFAULT 'Supporting',
    screentime_min  REAL,
    note            TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (production_id, character_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (production_id) REFERENCES Productions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (character_id) REFERENCES Characters(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Phases

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Phases (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    start_year INTEGER,
    end_year INTEGER,
    description TEXT
);
```

Load SQL files with:

```sql
.read filename.sql
```

---

# üå± Step 4: Seed the Data

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Normalize & Parse

* Extract columns: `title`, `type`, `release_date`, `mcu_phase`, `timeline_start/end`, `note`
* Standardize dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
* Fill NULLs where missing

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CSV Example

```csv
title,type,release_date,mcu_phase,timeline_start,timeline_end,note
Captain America: The First Avenger,Movie,2011-07-22,1,1942,1945,during WWII
Marvel‚Äôs Agent Carter (Season 1),Series,2015-01-06,1,1946,1947,
Iron Man,Movie,2008-05-02,1,2010,2010,
Venom,Adjacent,2018-10-05,,2018,2018,Sony universe connection
```

> Recommended: Keep timeline as integers, extra info in `note`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Python Script

```python
import sqlite3
import csv

conn = sqlite3.connect("marvel.db")
cur = conn.cursor()

with open("productions.csv", newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        cur.execute("""
            INSERT INTO Productions (
                title, type, release_date, mcu_phase, timeline_start, timeline_end, note
            ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        """, (
            row['title'],
            row['type'],
            row['release_date'] if row['release_date'] else None,
            int(row['mcu_phase']) if row['mcu_phase'] else None,
            int(row['timeline_start']) if row['timeline_start'] else None,
            int(row['timeline_end']) if row['timeline_end'] else None,
            row['note']
        ))

conn.commit()
conn.close()
print("‚úÖ Productions table seeded successfully!")
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run

```bash
python seed_productions.py
sqlite3 marvel.db
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Productions LIMIT 5;
sqlite3 marvel.db < seed_extras.sql
```

**CSV bug:** Ensure quotes for fields with commas.

---

# üìä Step 5: Queries

### üí° Output Formatting

**Option 1: Built-in formatting**

```sql
.mode column
.headers on
.width 30 10 15
```

```sql
SELECT title, mcu_phase, release_date FROM Productions LIMIT 5;
```

**Option 2: Box mode (if supported)**

```sql
.mode box
```

**Option 3: Python / Pandas**

```bash
python -m sqlite3 marvel.db "SELECT title, mcu_phase, release_date FROM Productions LIMIT 5;" | column -t
```

**Bonus:** Make `.mode column` permanent with `.sqliterc` in home directory.

---

### üîπ Example Queries

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Sanity checks**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_productions FROM Productions WHERE mcu_phase NOT NULL;

SELECT id, title, type, mcu_phase, timeline_start, timeline_end
FROM Productions
LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM productions
ORDER BY release_date;
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Phase-related**

```sql
SELECT mcu_phase, COUNT(*) AS num_productions
FROM Productions
WHERE mcu_phase IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY mcu_phase
ORDER BY mcu_phase;

SELECT mcu_phase, COUNT(*) AS production_count
FROM productions
GROUP BY mcu_phase
ORDER BY production_count DESC;

SELECT *
FROM productions
WHERE type = 'Series' AND mcu_phase = 4
ORDER BY title;

SELECT mcu_phase AS phase,
       ROUND(AVG(CAST(strftime('%Y', release_date) AS INTEGER)), 2) AS rounded_avg_year
FROM productions
WHERE mcu_phase IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY mcu_phase;
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Timeline exploration**

```sql
SELECT MIN(timeline_start) AS first_year, MAX(timeline_end) AS last_year
FROM Productions
WHERE mcu_phase IS NOT NULL;

SELECT title, type, mcu_phase, note
FROM Productions
WHERE timeline_start <= 2024 AND timeline_end >= 2024
ORDER BY release_date;
```

# Excursus ‚Äì üìä Optional Visualizations

Once your database is seeded, you can create **simple visualizations** to explore MCU data visually. This is entirely optional but makes the data more intuitive and portfolio-ready.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Phase Distribution

* **Goal:** Count the number of productions per MCU phase.
* **Why:** A bar chart shows which phases had the most movies or series.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT mcu_phase, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Productions
WHERE mcu_phase IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY mcu_phase
ORDER BY mcu_phase;
```

**Python (Matplotlib):**

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conn = sqlite3.connect("marvel.db")
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("""
    SELECT mcu_phase, COUNT(*) 
    FROM Productions 
    WHERE mcu_phase IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY mcu_phase
    ORDER BY mcu_phase
""")
data = cur.fetchall()
conn.close()

phases, counts = zip(*data)

plt.bar(phases, counts, color='crimson')
plt.xlabel("MCU Phase")
plt.ylabel("Number of Productions")
plt.title("Productions per MCU Phase")
plt.show()
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MCU Timeline Overview

* **Goal:** Plot productions along the MCU timeline using `timeline_start` and `timeline_end`.
* **Tip:** Exclude extreme outliers (e.g., pre-1940 productions) to focus on the main MCU storyline.

**SQL Query (Excluding Outliers):**

```sql
SELECT title, timeline_start, timeline_end
FROM Productions
WHERE timeline_start >= 1940;  -- adjust cutoff as needed
```

**Python (Matplotlib):**

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conn = sqlite3.connect("marvel.db")
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("""
    SELECT title, timeline_start, timeline_end 
    FROM Productions 
    WHERE timeline_start >= 1940
""")
data = cur.fetchall()
conn.close()

if data:
    titles, starts, ends = zip(*data)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    plt.scatter(starts, ends, color='navy')
    plt.xlabel("Timeline Start Year")
    plt.ylabel("Timeline End Year")
    plt.title("MCU Timeline Overview (Excluding Outliers)")
    plt.show()
else:
    print("No data available after filtering out outliers.")
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tools & Methods

* Python scripts with **Matplotlib** or **Pandas** for small charts.
* Export CSV from SQLite (`.mode csv` + `.output file.csv`) and plot in **Excel/Google Sheets** if preferred.

üí° **Tips:**

* Color-code points by **MCU phase** or production type (Movie, Series, One-Shot, Adjacent) to make charts more informative.
* Small visualizations like these provide immediate insight into timelines, phase distributions, and production patterns ‚Äî perfect for analysis and portfolio demos.
